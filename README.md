Sqlite should also be compiled with `ENABLE_UPDATE_DELETE_LIMIT` flag which enables an optional `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clause on UPDATE and DELETE statements. 

## Creating Database :ledger:
To create the database we can utilize the `initializer.py` to parse info from xlsx sheet and store it in database file `books.db`

## Usage :books:
The `server.py` will present three scenario to request and retrieve info of books.

In **Scenario 1** we input books Reference ID and if the books are left and are not taken by you( your username) then it updates the database or prints apporirate Response.

In **Scenario 2** we can search for books using authors,book name or genre using special characters.
For Searching based on author we give input in form of `/[Author Name Here]` and for book name `//[Book Name Here]` and for genre we directly input the genre.
